GENERAL POINTS:
1. If a command itself doesn't give error in case of invalid arguements then this shell also won't. For example,
in "ps -p 500 -o rss" where 500 is a pid which doesn't exist, ps doesn't throw an error and so will this shell.

2. This shell doesn't trim quotes for commands. For example, ls and "ls" are different commands for this shell
and it won't run "ls".

3. grep identifies pattern enclosed in double quotes, single quotes or passed directly.
